This project leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to process satellite imagery and automatically identify built-up regions not yet recorded in spatial databases. This approach aims to assist urban planners by providing up-to-date, accurate mapping, thereby enhancing the efficiency of urban planning and resource allocation in semi-urban regions.
